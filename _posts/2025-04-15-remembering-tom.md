Dr. Tomas J.F. Pavlasek (1923 -- 2025) was born in London, England and educated in Prague and Montreal. A lifelong McGill citizen, Tom earned his B. Eng (1944), M. Eng (1948) and PhD (1958) in Electrical Engineering at McGill and was appointed professor in 1953. He was named Emeritus Professor in 1984. His dedication to teaching, administration, and research was truly inspiring throughout his career. He continued teaching and advising at McGill long after retirement, reflecting his deep passion and unwavering commitment.

Tom gave generously to the Lachine community, lending his time and energy to libraries, school committees, Summerlea United Church, the CLSC, and numerous neighbourhood causes and events. Later, he and Lois were a vibrant part of life at The Cambridge in Pointe-Claire, where they shared many meaningful years as cherished members of that community.
